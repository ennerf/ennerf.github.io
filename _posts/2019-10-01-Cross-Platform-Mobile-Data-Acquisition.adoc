== Problem Statement / Why?

* It's easy to interact with joysticks, but every OS and language has their own bindings. Some joysticks work differently than others
* Joysticks may already be overkill for examples that need 1-2 different user inputs. Keyboards would make more sense, but KB libraries are even more of a mess.
** Some languages don't support complex non-blocking keyboard events at all (e.g. MATLAB)
* Sometimes 80% of the example code ends up dealing with whatever user input library


== What?

We ended up building a mobile app that lets us access joystick-like input buttons and axes, as well as gather feedback from all of the onboard sensors.


== Examples / How to use?

Examples in MATLAB / Python / C++ and maybe Scope screenshots? 

* YouTube video on 6dof pose w/ magnetometer
* Logging
* Controlling arm through pose, or maybe single actuator through Gyroscope

== Connectivity

Not all phones are created equally, e.g., Samsumg Galaxy S8 has significant issues with 5GHz WiFi. iPhone is better there. Compare WiFI 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, USB->Ethernet dongle, WiFi tethering, USB tethering
