The acquisition and processing of a video stream can be very computationally expensive. Typical image processing applications split the work across multiple threads, one acquiring the images, and another one running the actual algorithms. In MATLAB we can get multi-threading by interfacing with other languages, but there is a significant cost associated to exchanging data across the resulting language barrier. The default ways for data conversion can quickly become prohibitively expensive. In this blog post we compare different approaches for getting data through MATLAB's Java interface, and we show how to acquire high resolution video streams in real-time and with low overhead.

//Video acquisition is computationally intensive enough that is has to be done on a background thread. In MATLAB we can easily do this by using interfaces to other languages. However, once the data becomes significantly large, translating the acquired data back into a MATLAB format can quickly become a bottleneck. Below we show a generally applicable approach that we developed for getting 1080p h264 streaming video into MATLAB with very low overhead.

//To work around limitations due to MATLAB's single threaded nature, we often have to resort to use interfaces to other languages, such as MEX or the Java interface, in order to do data acquisition on a background thread. However, in some cases, such as when trying to stream 1080p h264 video, there is so much data that the translation layer to other languages becomes a bottleneck. Below we show how techniques originally developed for inter-process communication can be used to get large amounts of data into MATLAB with very low overhead.

== Motivation

For our booth at ICRA 2014 we put together a demo system in MATLAB that used stereo vision for tracking bean bags, and a robot arm to pick them up. We used two IP cameras that streamed link:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264[H.264] video over link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol[RTSP]. While developing the image processing and robot control parts were comparatively simple, it proved to be a challenge to get streaming video data from both cameras into MATLAB fast enough to be useful.

* link:http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/ip-camera.html[IP Camera Support] didn't exist at the time and only supported link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG[MJPEG] over link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol[HTTP]
* link:http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/matlab-webcam.html[USB Webcam Support] only supported USB cameras
* link:http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/imread.html[imread] and link:http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/webread.html[webread] were limited to HTTP and too slow for real-time

Since we didn't want to port the code to another language, we instead wrote a small library that enabled us to acquire video data in an efficient manner. The project was later open sourced as link:http://www.github.com/HebiRobotics/HebiCam[HebiCam].

== Technical Background

Most video streams that are sent over the network get compressed in order to save bandwidth (exceptions include GigE cameras). While the cameras often include specialized hardware (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit[ASIC]) to do the encoding, the decoding on the computer side tends to happen in Software. Since the decoding is quite CPU intensive, the acquisition needs to happen in a different thread than the processing.

[NOTE]
Note that Intel has added hardware support for encoding and decoding to their CPUs starting in 2011 (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Quick_Sync_Video[QuickSync]), but there is unfortunately a lack of library support.

Due to MATLAB's single threaded nature, we need to resort to external languages for getting background threads. Out of the box MATLAB provides two interfaces to other languages:  https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/introducing-mex-files.html[MEX] for calling C/C++ code, and the https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/product-overview.html[Java Interface] for calling Java code. For a variety of reasons, e.g., simplified development and cross-platform deployment, we decided to use the Java interface. The diagram below shows a simplified overview.

[.text-center]

image::{imagesdir}/streaming/stereocam-matlab.svg[width=100%]

Starting background threads and getting the video data into Java was comparatively straight forward. We used the excellent link:https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv[JavaCV] library, which is a Java wrapper around link:https://opencv.org/[OpenCV] and link:https://www.ffmpeg.org/[FFMpeg] that includes pre-compiled native binaries for all major operating systems. The main challenge was to get the image data across the translation layer back into MATLAB.

In order to process images at a frame rate of 30 fps in real-time, the total time budget of the main MATLAB thread is 33ms per cycle. Thus, the overhead incurred on the main thread needs to be sufficiently low, i.e., a low number of milliseconds, to leave enough time for the actual processing.

While the automated translation from and to Java types tends to be sufficient for most applications, it is very inefficient for large and multi dimensional matrices. For example, a `1080x1920x3` MATLAB image matrix gets translated to a `byte[1080][1920][3]` Java array. This results in separate array objects for every single pixel in the image.  Even for very low resolution images this default conversion is unfortunately nowhere close to fast enough.

As an additional complication, Java uses a different memory layout than MATLAB. While Java stores pixel data in row-major order, MATLAB stores images transposed and in column-major order. For example, if the pixel data for a Java image would be laid out as `[RGB][RGB][RGB]...`, the same image would be laid out as `[RRR...][GGG...][BBB...]` in MATLAB.  (`R`, `G`, `B` correspond to red, green, and blue values for one pixel)

* Acquiring video on a background thread
* Transferring data across the language barrier
* Converting to a MATLAB readable format
* Using the image in MATLAB

Getting images in has to happen within max a few ms, otherwise it's impossible to do any actual work on the images. Since decoding can take an entire thread by itself, background threading is required. However, there is too much data to transfer through the standard language barriers.
////

== Data Translation

We compared five different ways to get image data from Java into MATLAB. Note that the benchmarks in this section measure only the overhead on the MATLAB main thread. The reason for this is that while additional overhead in a background thread may increase overall latency, it doesn't impact the available time budget for actual processing. The full benchmark code is available link:https://github.com/HebiRobotics/HebiCam/tree/benchmark[here].

*1. Default 3D Array*

By default MATLAB image matrices convert to and from `byte[height][width][channels]` arrays. However, while the dimensions match, there are some additional problems:

* `byte` gets converted to `int8` instead of `uint8`, resulting in an invalid image matrix
* a standard cast calling `uint8(matrix)` doesn't work because it sets all negative values to zero
* casting via `typecast(matrix, 'uint8')` only works on single dimension vectors

Thus, in order to get a valid MATLAB image, we need to do several operations.

[source,matlab]
----
% (1) Get matrix from byte[height][width][channels]
data = getRawFormat3d(this.javaConverter);
[height,width,channels] = size(data);

% (2) Reshape matrix to vector
vector = reshape(data, width * height * channels, 1);

% (3) Cast int8 data to uint8
vector = typecast(vector, 'uint8');

% (4) Reshape vector back to original shape
image = reshape(vector, height, width, channels);
----

*2. Compressed 1D Array*

A common approach to move image data across distributed components (e.g. link:http://www.ros.org/[ROS]) is to encode the individual images using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG[MJPEG] compression before sending them. Doing this within a single process is obviously wasteful, but we included it because it is common practice in some systems. Since MATLAB does not offer a way to decompress jpeg images in memory, we would need to go through a file first.

[source,matlab]
----
% (1) Get compressed data from byte[]
data = getJpegData(this.javaConverter);

% (2) Save as jpeg file
fileID = fopen('tmp.jpg','w+');
fwrite(fileID, data, 'int8');
fclose(fileID);

% (3) Read jpeg file
image = imread('tmp.jpg');
----

*3. Java Layout as 1D Pixel Array*

The most common approach is to copy the backing array behind Java's `BufferedImage` class and to reshape the memory using MATLAB (compare this link:https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/100155-how-can-i-convert-a-java-image-object-into-a-matlab-image-matrix#answer_109503[answer]).

[source,matlab]
----
% (1) Get data from byte[] and cast to correct type
data = getJavaPixelFormat1d(this.javaConverter);
data = typecast(data, 'uint8');
[h,w,c] = size(this.matlabImage); % get dim info

% (2) Reshape matrix for indexing
pixelsData = reshape(data, 3, w, h);

% (3) Transpose and convert from row major to col major format (RGB case)
image = cat(3, ...
    transpose(reshape(pixelsData(3, :, :), w, h)), ...
    transpose(reshape(pixelsData(2, :, :), w, h)), ...
    transpose(reshape(pixelsData(1, :, :), w, h)));
----

*4. MATLAB Layout as 1D Pixel Array*

This approach is the same as 3. with the difference being that the changes to the memory layout happen prior to copying into MATLAB.

[source,matlab]
----
% (1) Get data from byte[] and cast to correct type
data = getMatlabPixelFormat1d(this.javaConverter);
[h,w,c] = size(this.matlabImage);  % get dim info
vector = typecast(data, 'uint8');

% (2) Interpret pre-laid out memory as matrix
image = reshape(vector,h,w,c);
----

Note that the most efficient way we found to convert the data layout on the Java side was by using OpenCV's `split` and `transpose` functions before writing into the shared buffer. The code can be found in link:https://github.com/HebiRobotics/HebiCam/blob/master/src/main/java/us/hebi/matlab/streaming/MatlabImageConverterBGR.java[MatlabImageConverterBGR] and link:https://github.com/HebiRobotics/HebiCam/blob/master/src/main/java/us/hebi/matlab/streaming/MatlabImageConverterGrayscale.java[MatlabImageConverterGrayscale].

*5. MATLAB Layout as Shared Memory*

This approach is the same as 4. with the difference being that the data is read from shared memory using link:https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/memmapfile.html[memmapfile], thus bypassing the Java translation layer entirely. Shared memory is typically used for inter-process communication, but it can also be used within a single process. Running it in the same process also simplifies synchronization since we can use standard Java locks.

[source,matlab]
----
% (1) Lock memory
lock(this.javaObj);

% (2) Force a copy of the data
image = this.memFile.Data.pixels * 1;

% (3) Unlock memory
unlock(this.javaObj);
----

Note that `memmapfile` assumes that the data doesn't change and internally only returns a pointer to the underlying data. Thus, we need to force a copy, e.g., by multiplying by one. Also, the simplified code snippet above does not guarantee correct behavior as users could interrupt the execution (ctrl+c) between the `lock` and `unlock` operations. We can solve this by doing one of the following

* Make the internal logic smarter to handle cases where users didn't call `unlock`
* Use link:https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/oncleanup.html[onCleanup] to guarantee unlocking, e.g., `c = onCleanup(@()unlock(this.javaObj))`
* Create a custom class that locks in the constructor and unlocks in the destructor

However, even if the `unlock` call is in a destructor that is guaranteed to run when exiting scope, the Java logic still needs to handle cases where the code gets interrupted before the `lock` call.

== Results

All benchmarks were run in MATLAB 2017b on an link:https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc6i7kyk.html[Intel NUC6I7KYK]. The performance was measured using MATLAB's link:https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/timeit.html[timeit] function. All measurements are in units of milliseconds. The full benchmark code is available link:https://github.com/HebiRobotics/HebiCam/tree/benchmark[here]. 

The two tables below show the results for converting color (RGB) images as well as grayscale images. The background color of each cell represents the rough overhead on the main MATLAB thread as a ratio of the total available processing budget for a frame rate of 30 fps, i.e., 33.3 ms.

* Green: below 10% or 3.3ms
* Yellow: below 50% or 16.5ms
* Orange: below 100% or 33.3ms
* Red: above 100%

The results show that the default conversion as well as jpeg compression are essentially non-starters for color images. For grayscale images the default conversion works reasonably well due to the fact that the resulting 2D array (`byte[height][width]`) stores the data much more efficiently, but it still is not a great option.

Copying the raw pixels from a Java image is significantly faster, but there is still too much overhead caused by the need to change the memory layout.

The by far best option is to convert the layout outside of MATLAB and if possible bypass the Java translation layer entirely by using shared memory. This approach scales very well and can even transfer 4K images in real-time.

[NOTE]
Note that we typically use lower resolution images (e.g. 480p) to speed up the processing. We only use higher resolution images (e.g. 1080p) when we use MATLAB as a live video display.

== Final Notes

After developing link:https://github.com/HebiRobotics/HebiCam[HebiCam] we were able to develop and run the entire stereo vision + controls demo entirely in MATLAB. However, we decided to never develop a custom stereo vision setup for an exhibit again. The colors and lines on the carpet caused the camera calibration to fail repeatedly and we ended up spending more time to get the cameras calibrated than we spent on the entire initial development of HebiCam.

The biggest takeaway for us was that MATLAB supports shared memory. We had used shared memory before for inter-process communication in Java and C++, but we somehow assumed that MATLAB wouldn't support it. We eventually looked into this and found that MATLAB does have support, and that the implementation is actually quite nice. The data definition can even map the memory to an array of structs with multiple variables.

Using shared memory we can bypass the Java translation layer entirely and even include meta data such as timestamps or frame sequence numbers. However, for us the most interesting application is its use for inter process communication. For example, we can have two MATLAB instances exchange almost arbitrary aounts of data by simply defining a common shared struct.

This enables us to run one instance that tracks a target at a low rate (e.g. 30 Hz), and another instance for calculating and executing trajectories at a higher rate (e.g. >100 Hz), without needing to setup an inter-process communication framework like LCM, or the need to define any marshalling.

We frequently run into cases where we would like to run two MATLAB instances, one for tracking a target at a low rate (e.g. 30 Hz), and another for calculating and executing trajectories at a higher rate (e.g. 200 Hz). Using shared memory we can update the goal target in real-time without needing to setup an inter-process-communication framework like ROS, or the need to define any messages or custom binary formats.

We will publish more details about inter-process communication as well as synchronization between multiple instances in a future blog post.

// Using Java's `Unsafe` we can even implement synchronization mechanisms in shared memory that enable safe inter process communication. This means that we can exchange large amounts of data between MATLAB instances extremely efficiently, without the need for any complex frameworks. The data format can be changed at runtime, without worrying about recompiling and generating message definitions.

Unfortunately, while the automated translation from and to Java types tends to be sufficient, it is very inefficient for large and multi dimensional matrices. For example, a 1080x1920x3 MATLAB matrix gets translated to a byte[1080][1920][3] Java array. Thus, there is a separate array object for every single pixel in the image.

We care mostly about reducing the translation part that has to happen on the main MATLAB thread, so in general it is better to do as much of the work before crossing the barrier.

* Default conversion (byte[][][]) allocates a 3 element byte array for every pixel. RGB conversion is a non starter. Greyscale translates to byte[][], which works somewhat better.

* Message passing systems (e.g. ROS) often compress images as e.g. Jpeg before sending it to other nodes. We could do something similar here, but MATLAB doesn't have methods for decompressing memory. Going through a file is pretty expensive. Cheaper for RGB, but more expensive for grayscale.

* Accessing the backing byte[] array of a BufferedImage and then reshaping works better, but needs quite a bit of memory shuffling.

* Matching the memory layout before transporting as a byte[] array is significantly better.

* Using the same data, but transporting via shared memory is even better. There is some minor overhead for locking as well as a single memcopy in MATLAB.
////

////
== Reshaping memory layout

Transposed column Major, i.e., [R R R R ...] [G G G G ...] etc. instead of [RGB][RGB][RGB], and height x width instead of width x height.

* Inside MATLAB using reshape
* Using Java loop
* Using OpenCV calls

== Synchronizing shared memory

* Synchronize using Java locks
** MATLAB doesn't provide locking mechanisms
** Difficult to lock raw memory anyways

* Unlock must be called. no try{}finally{} in MATLAB, but ctrl-c shouldn't end up in bad states
** Work around the issue with extra logic
** use onCleanup()
** use custom handle class with destructor
////

////
Several problems, e.g.,

* Data needs to be locked properly
* Once allocated objects need to continue to work
* User can ctrl+c at any time. There is no guarantee to always call unlock.
** User needs to be able to lock multiple times
** Background thread needs to have a timeout to not break acquisition, e.g., min 1 frame per 5 sec

* try onCleanup(@()f): https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/oncleanup.html
** could call unlock() that has bool to know whether it's locked.

== ------ DEPRECATED ------

In my quest to creating robot APIs for MATLAB I've encountered many problems. One of the most challenging ones was to find a way to acquire h264 video streams in real-time in order to enable quick prototyping of computer vision algorithms.

The acquisition and decoding of a video stream can be a very computationally expensive operation, so in a typical (e.g. C++ or Java) program there would be a background thread acquiring the images and another thread that would run the actual algorithm. This approach doesn't work well for MATLAB since the language is fundamentally single threaded. There are ways to get multi-threading by interfacing with other languages, but there is a significant cost to crossing the barrier to MATLAB and converting the data into a compatible format.

I've tried various different approaches in side projects between 2011 and 2013 to get this running, but I always ended up unsatisfied. Eventually in 2014 this became more of a priority and I finally found a good solution. 

This blog post will provide an overview of the problem, the approaches that didn't work, and the final solution.

== Vanilla MATLAB

MATLAB provides a variety of toolboxes and hardware support packages for image acquisition. Below is a list of the ones that I'm aware of:

[width="100%",options="header",cols="1a,3a"]
|====================
| Package | Problems 

| link:http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/ip-camera.html[IP Camera Support] |
* Didn't exist at the time
* Limited to mjpeg over http

| link:http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/matlab-webcam.html[USB Webcam Support] |
* Only supports USB cameras

| link:http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/imread.html[imread], link:http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/webread.html[webread] |
* Does everything in the MATLAB thread, which is too slow (<2 fps) 
* Limited to http

|====================


== Common Approach

// Similar to ROS / LCM - acquire image in 1 process and publish as jpeg
// --> quality reduction and huge load on the system
// --> not feasible for >480p

// MATLAB thread: retrieve encoded data, decode to raw, convert to matlab format

Assuming a frame rate of 30 fps, the total time budget in the MATLAB thread is 33 ms per image. In order to be able to actually do useful operations on the images, the acquisition part shouldn't take more than 5-10 ms.

// ROS toolbox -> ros/msg/sensor_msgs/internal/ImageReader.decompressImg() uses javax.imageIO to read jpeg, then converts to uint8 array and does reshape.

== Dedicated System

// implemented as much as possible in background thread, direct acquisition

// MATLAB thread: convert to MATLAB format

link:http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8028-mmread[mmread] uses MEX with FFMpeg. 
link:https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv[mexopencv] uses MEX with OpenCV.


== Efficient Data Exchange
